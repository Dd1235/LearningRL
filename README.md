# LearningRL

My attempt at teaching myself some Reinforcement Learning, and documenting stuff along the way, so as to help with revision, better my understanding, and maybe help others too(hopefully).

Notes from datacamp courses on basic implementations would be updated [here](https://github.com/Dd1235/Notes/tree/main/DatacampCourses/ML_Fundamentals)
(Private repo as of now)
