# LearningRL

ok update, I am reconsidering my entire study plan, especially from Sutton and Barto after reading [this](https://www.argmin.net/p/cool-kids-keep) I am perplexed now 😶‍🌫️😵‍💫 what do I do?

My attempt at teaching myself some Reinforcement Learning, and documenting stuff along the way, so as to help with revision, better my understanding, and maybe help others too(hopefully).

Notes from datacamp courses on basic implementations would be updated [here](https://github.com/Dd1235/Notes/tree/main/DatacampCourses/ML_Fundamentals)
(Private repo as of now)

## Table of Contents

- [Introduction](Introduction.md)

PS the markdown might not look right in the github preview for formuale, but works with any markdown previewer in VSCode or any other md previewer.

## Codes

- [Bandits](code/Bandits)

Implementation of Multi armed bandits problem, using epison greedy, and upper confidence bound action method, and sample average and constant step estimators. Both stationary(normal distirbution) and non-stationary environments simulated.
