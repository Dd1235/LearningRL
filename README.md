# LearningRL

My attempt at teaching myself some Reinforcement Learning, and documenting stuff along the way, so as to help with revision, better my understanding, and maybe help others too(hopefully).

## Table of Contents

- [Introduction](SBnotes/Introduction.md)
- [Ch2 Multi Armed Bandits](SBnotes/MultiArmedBandits.md)

PS the markdown might not look right in the github preview for formuale, but works with any markdown previewer in VSCode or any other md previewer.

## Codes

- [Bandits](code/Bandits)

Implementation of Multi armed bandits problem, using epison greedy, and upper confidence bound action method, and sample average and constant step estimators. Both stationary(normal distirbution) and non-stationary environments simulated.
